# ChatGPT-old-chats-finder-ai-free
I have had about 1000 chats with chatgpt. When I needed to find a specific chat, i searched it in chatgpt's default search tool, it suggested me about 15 chats with the same keyword lol. So, I generated a free CLI tool to find which is in your mind. Simply paste your gemini API key (free, no credit card) in the config file

# ChatGPT-old-chats-finder-ai-free
I have had about 1000 chats with ChatGPT. When I needed to find a specific chat, I searched for it in ChatGPT's default search tool, and it suggested about 15 chats with the same keyword, lol. So, I built a free CLI tool to help you find what's on your mind.

 Simply paste your Gemini API key (free, no credit card) in the config file

Works well
Run python main.py
Describe what you need to find
Enter some tags
It will filter the top 15 results, & AI will filter the top 3 out of it
It will display what it thinks about it, and the chat id
Copy the chat ID and done
eg id - 68ef633e-8150-8322-985e-69deb7e6f790

Get the Gemini API for free. You need just a Google account - https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

Gemini api key - config.py (change the API)
gemini prompt - gemini_ranker.py (Keep default or enhance yourself)
